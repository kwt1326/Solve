pnpm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your database configuration
```

### Database Setup

```bash
# Make sure PostgreSQL is running and create the database
createdb solve

# The application will automatically create tables on startup (development mode)
```

### Environment Variables

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=solve

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
```

## Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode (with watch)
pnpm run start:dev

# Production mode
pnpm run build
pnpm run start:prod

# Debug mode

## API Documentation

See [API.md](./API.md) for detailed API documentation including:
- All available endpoints
- Request/response examples
- Data models
- Authentication requirements
- Business rules

## Quick API Overview

### Core Endpoints

```bash
# Connect wallet (creates user if doesn't exist)
POST /api/users/connect

# Create bounty
POST /api/bounties

# Get bounties with filtering
GET /api/bounties?sortBy=newest&status=open

# Submit answer
POST /api/answers

# Select winner
POST /api/bounties/{id}/select-winner
```

### Authentication

All endpoints use wallet address authentication via the `x-wallet-address` header:

```http
x-wallet-address: 0x1234567890abcdef...
```

## Database Schema

### Entities
- **User**: Wallet-based user profiles with stats
- **Bounty**: Problem posts with rewards
- **Answer**: Solutions submitted by users

### Key Relationships
- User ‚Üí Bounties (one-to-many)
- User ‚Üí Answers (one-to-many)  
- Bounty ‚Üí Answers (one-to-many)
- Bounty ‚Üí WinningAnswer (one-to-one)

## Business Logic

### Bounty Lifecycle
1. **Create**: User posts bounty with ETH reward
2. **Answer**: Other users submit solutions
3. **Select Winner**: Bounty creator chooses best answer
4. **Complete**: Reward is distributed to winner

### User Statistics
- Total rewards earned
- Bounties posted count
- Answers given count
- Winning answers count

## Development

```bash
# Linting
pnpm run lint

# Testing
pnpm run test
pnpm run test:e2e
pnpm run test:cov

# Database migrations (if needed)
pnpm run migration:generate
pnpm run migration:run
```
